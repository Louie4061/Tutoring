Here is some raw stuff that I can use to test:

insert student:
{
  "StudentID": "123456",
  "FirstName": "John",
  "LastName": "Doe",
  "Country": "Australia",
  "Year": 3,
  "Phone": "+61 412 345 678",
  "Email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

delete or get student has req.params.id;

Routes:
/students : put : adds a student to the database
/students : delete : clears the database
/students : get : gets all students from the database
/students/:id : get : gets a student by id
/students/:id : delete : removes a student
