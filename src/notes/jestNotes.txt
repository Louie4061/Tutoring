# an example of a mock function:
jest.fn() creates a mock funciton, like a regular funciton. 
mockReturnValue('Alice') tells it to always return Alice

const mockFetchUserName = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('Alice');
const greeting = greetUser(mockFetchUserName);

in the function we call, mockFetchUserName() and so we return
the vaue Alice early, this is convinient for our tests as we don't disrupt stuff
